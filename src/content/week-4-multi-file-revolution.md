# Week 4 Update: Multi-File Revolution - Building the Mathematical IDE of the Future

## The Breakthrough Moment

This week marked a turning point for Infinity Archive. What started as a single-file Lean editor has evolved into a proper mathematical IDE with full multi-file project support. For the first time, you can create a project, add multiple `.lean` files, and work on them seamlessly - just like any professional development environment.

As someone coming from pure mathematics, I never fully appreciated how complex "simple" IDE features actually are until I tried building them myself.

## Before vs After: A Night and Day Difference

**Three weeks ago:**

- Single file editor
- No project organization  
- Manual content management
- Basic Lean verification

**Today:**

- Professional file explorer with collapsible sidebar
- Create/delete files with the L+ button
- Auto-save every 2 seconds (no more lost work!)
- Real-time InfoView that tracks your cursor across files
- Proper project structure that scales

The difference is visceral. Before, using the tool felt like working in a scratchpad. Now it feels like a real mathematical workspace where you can organize thoughts, build complex proofs across multiple files, and trust that your work is preserved.

## Key Technical Wins

### Database Evolution

The biggest change was restructuring our data model. Instead of projects containing a single `content` field, we now have a proper one-to-many relationship where projects contain multiple files. This seems obvious in retrospect, but required migrating existing projects and rebuilding the entire file management system.

### File Management That Actually Works

The file explorer isn't just a pretty sidebar - it's designed for mathematical workflows:

- **L+ creates new files** (mathematician-friendly, not just a "+" button)
- **Intelligent file naming** (automatically adds .lean extension)
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive operations
- **Active file highlighting** so you always know where you are

### Auto-save with Conflict Prevention

This was trickier than expected. We needed to preserve editor state when switching files while also auto-saving changes. The solution involves maintaining a local content cache and debounced saves. It sounds technical, but the user experience is seamless - your work just persists without thinking about it.

## The Problems We Hit (And Mostly Solved)

### The LaTeX Block Bug

This one drove me crazy for a day. When switching between files, custom LaTeX command blocks would mysteriously migrate to the bottom of the editor. After digging into Monaco Editor's state management, we found the issue was with decoration restoration. It's mostly fixed now, though I'm still fine-tuning the edge cases.

### File Switching Performance

With multiple files open, we needed to ensure smooth transitions. The challenge was preserving editor state (cursor position, scroll, selections) while loading new content. The solution involved careful state serialization and restoration.

### Database Migration Complexity

Converting existing single-file projects to multi-file structure required a migration endpoint. Not glamorous work, but essential for users who had already created projects on the platform.

## What This Means for Mathematical Work

As a mathematics PhD student, I'm constantly switching between different parts of a proof, referencing earlier results, and building complex arguments step by step. Having proper file organization changes how you think about structuring mathematical work.

Instead of one monolithic file, you can now:

- **Separate definitions from theorems**
- **Organize by mathematical topic** (algebra.lean, topology.lean, etc.)
- **Build hierarchical arguments** across multiple files
- **Reuse results** more naturally

This mirrors how we actually think about mathematics - not as single proofs, but as interconnected webs of ideas.

## Next Week: Cross-File Imports

The big missing piece is cross-file imports. Right now, each file verifies independently, which limits what you can build. Next week's priority is implementing:

```lean
-- File: BasicDefs.lean
def myFunction (n : Nat) : Nat := n + 1

-- File: MainTheorem.lean  
import BasicDefs  -- This should work!

theorem test : myFunction 5 = 6 := rfl
```

This requires parsing import statements, bundling related files for verification, and maintaining proper dependency graphs. It's complex, but it's what transforms this from a toy editor into a real mathematical development environment.

## The Bigger Picture

Four weeks ago, this was just an idea: "What if formal mathematics felt as natural as writing on paper?" We're not there yet, but we're making real progress.

Every week, the tool becomes more usable. More importantly, it's becoming something I actually want to use for my own mathematical work. That's the real test - not just building features, but building something that enhances how mathematicians think and work.

The vision remains ambitious: turning Earth into a collaborative mathematical computer where every theorem builds on previous work, every insight is preserved, and every mathematician can contribute to humanity's understanding of mathematical truth.

But revolutions start with practical tools that work reliably day-to-day. This week, we got a lot closer to that reality.

## Try It Yourself

The multi-file system is live at [inftychi.vercel.app](https://inftychi.vercel.app). Connect your wallet, create a project, and click the "FILES" button to open the explorer. Hit L+ to create your first file and start building.

If you're a mathematician (especially one working in formal verification), your feedback shapes where this goes next. What feels clunky? What's missing? What would make this genuinely useful for your work?

**Status**: Week 4 complete. Multi-file IDE operational.  
**Next**: Cross-file imports and folder organization.  
**Goal**: Making formal mathematics feel natural.

Building the future, one file at a time. ðŸš€
