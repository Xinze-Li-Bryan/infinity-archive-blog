# Gallery Images

Place your gallery images in this directory.

The images should be named according to the configuration in `/src/app/gallery/page.tsx`.

Currently configured images:
- image1.jpg
- image2.jpg
- image3.jpg

You can add more images and update the `galleryImages` array in the page component.
